'''
Given an array nums of size n, return the majority element.
The majority element is the element that appears more than ⌊n / 2⌋ times. 
You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [3,2,3]
Output: 3

Example 2:
Input: nums = [2,2,1,1,1,2,2]
Output: 2
 
Constraints:
n == nums.length
1 <= n <= 5 * 104
-109 <= nums[i] <= 109
Follow-up: Could you solve the problem in linear time and in O(1) space?
'''
# for linear time, we have used Boyer Morre Algo
class Solution:
    def majorityElement(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        res, count = 0, 0

        for n in nums:
            if count == 0:
                res = n
            count += (1 if n == res else -1)
        return res
